      <description>Backing up and moving all the media on my phone to the external hard drive When your computer/phone is unresponsive due to the large number of files it might work to use adb, slightly more complicated due to lack of some of the coreutils.
Another solution is to use a server app and connect via the web interface and copy over that way. I like to use X-plore
Normal way would be to plug it in via USB and copy over that way.</description>
