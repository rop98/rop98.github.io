      <description>Installing roms on Samsung galaxy tab 2 and thoughts on the device  https://www.droidthunder.com/flash-custom-rom-twrp-recovery/ https://androidfilehost.com/?w=profile&amp;amp;uid=23329332407587552 http://andi34.github.io/roms_tab2_slim.html http://andi34.github.io  Recently I bought a second hand samsung galaxy tab 2 as a way to get some coding and reading done in more places.
It&amp;rsquo;s size is only 2.5 inches smaller than my smallest laptop, which is also my main workhorse (Thinkpad x260).
I did not like the original ROM running on it, so I decided to see if more performance could be squeezed out of it.</description>

      <description>Backing up and moving all the media on my phone to the external hard drive When your computer/phone is unresponsive due to the large number of files it might work to use adb, slightly more complicated due to lack of some of the coreutils.
Another solution is to use a server app and connect via the web interface and copy over that way. I like to use X-plore
Normal way would be to plug it in via USB and copy over that way.</description>
