      <description>Struggles with Inkscape The one thing I did not enjoy about working with Inkscape is probably not their fault.
An issue with how it is distributed among linux distributions.
As I was just testing it out, I thought an AppImage would be best.
I discovered it was lacking extension support, luckily the community also had this problem.
Thought reverting to an earlier version would help, it did not.
Finally, I bit the bullet and decided to install the native package on arch.</description>
