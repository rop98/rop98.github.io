      <description>Vim for college pattern matching is amazing \d and :help regular Character classes:	*/character-classes* magic nomagic	matches ~ |/\i|	\i	\i	identifier character (see &#39;isident&#39; option) |/\I|	\I	\I	like &amp;quot;\i&amp;quot;, but excluding digits |/\k|	\k	\k	keyword character (see &#39;iskeyword&#39; option) |/\K|	\K	\K	like &amp;quot;\k&amp;quot;, but excluding digits |/\f|	\f	\f	file name character (see &#39;isfname&#39; option) |/\F|	\F	\F	like &amp;quot;\f&amp;quot;, but excluding digits |/\p|	\p	\p	printable character (see &#39;isprint&#39; option) |/\P|	\P	\P	like &amp;quot;\p&amp;quot;, but excluding digits |/\s|	\s	\s	whitespace character: &amp;lt;Space&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;Tab&amp;gt; |/\S|	\S	\S	non-whitespace character; opposite of \s |/\d|	\d	\d	digit:	[0-9] |/\D|	\D	\D	non-digit:	[^0-9] |/\x|	\x	\x	hex digit:	[0-9A-Fa-f] |/\X|	\X	\X	non-hex digit:	[^0-9A-Fa-f] |/\o|	\o	\o	octal digit:	[0-7] |/\O|	\O	\O	non-octal digit:	[^0-7] |/\w|	\w	\w	word character:	[0-9A-Za-z_] |/\W|	\W	\W	non-word character:	[^0-9A-Za-z_] |/\h|	\h	\h	head of word character:	[A-Za-z_] |/\H|	\H	\H	non-head of word character:	[^A-Za-z_] |/\a|	\a	\a	alphabetic character:	[A-Za-z] |/\A|	\A	\A	non-alphabetic character:	[^A-Za-z] |/\l|	\l	\l	lowercase character:	[a-z] |/\L|	\L	\L	non-lowercase character:	[^a-z] |/\u|	\u	\u	uppercase character:	[A-Z] |/\U|	\U	\U	non-uppercase character	[^A-Z] |/\_|	\_x	\_x	where x is any of the characters above: character class with end-of-line included (end of character classes) magic nomagic	matches ~ |/\e|	\e	\e	&amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt; |/\t|	\t	\t	&amp;lt;Tab&amp;gt; |/\r|	\r	\r	&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt; |/\b|	\b	\b	&amp;lt;BS&amp;gt; |/\n|	\n	\n	end-of-line |/~|	~	\~	last given substitute string |/\1|	\1	\1	same string as matched by first \(\) |/\2|	\2	\2	Like &amp;quot;\1&amp;quot;, but uses second \(\)  so vim has the ability to do quick pattern matching with :s and with searching vim also can repeat the last : command with @:  general vim :set spell!</description>

      <description>Installing roms on Samsung galaxy tab 2 and thoughts on the device  https://www.droidthunder.com/flash-custom-rom-twrp-recovery/ https://androidfilehost.com/?w=profile&amp;amp;uid=23329332407587552 http://andi34.github.io/roms_tab2_slim.html http://andi34.github.io  Recently I bought a second hand samsung galaxy tab 2 as a way to get some coding and reading done in more places.
It&amp;rsquo;s size is only 2.5 inches smaller than my smallest laptop, which is also my main workhorse (Thinkpad x260).
I did not like the original ROM running on it, so I decided to see if more performance could be squeezed out of it.</description>

      <description>Backing up and moving all the media on my phone to the external hard drive When your computer/phone is unresponsive due to the large number of files it might work to use adb, slightly more complicated due to lack of some of the coreutils.
Another solution is to use a server app and connect via the web interface and copy over that way. I like to use X-plore
Normal way would be to plug it in via USB and copy over that way.</description>

      <title>Notes on progress with Inkscape</title>

      <description>Struggles with Inkscape The one thing I did not enjoy about working with Inkscape is probably not their fault.
An issue with how it is distributed among linux distributions.
As I was just testing it out, I thought an AppImage would be best.
I discovered it was lacking extension support, luckily the community also had this problem.
Thought reverting to an earlier version would help, it did not.
Finally, I bit the bullet and decided to install the native package on arch.</description>

      <description>Obvious ones Double Jump - Learned from &amp;lsquo;TheBaldChick - Godot 3: How to make your character double jump&amp;rsquo; 2020-05-22 This took forever. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to add double jump to any game since I downloaded godot.
I learned a lot just going through the basics and now I understand the underlying logic a bit more.
Learning from multiple sources is a good and bad thing.
If I try to follow just one way of doing it, it will be better for that one way but my knowledge is limited in breadth.</description>

      <description>I need to figure out how to change the post time in a simple way, this T and Z business is incredibly confusing. (EDIT) it was not too difficult, it is just set to another timezone, so, it won&amp;rsquo;t publish until it is actually that time or later.
Sites I found interesting  Bryan Lundukes website Beepboop.xyz (This was also done using orgmode) Rakhim/emacscast (This was done using orgmode) HexDSL (Using blop) GideonWolfe (Hugo, Terminal theme)  Bryan Lunduke Journal  The site strikes me as different because of the odd layout and colorscheme.</description>

      <description>Overview Syncthing is like megasync, dropbox or onedrive but using your own storage,
Syncthing is open source, syncthing can be run locally within your LAN without using global data. In order to use it with only local data, UPNP needs to be enabled on the local network. This can be set usually on 10.0.0.2 or by connecting to your router. Then in the advanced settings, UPNP will be found alongside the DLNA settings.</description>
